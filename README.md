This project simulates the Material Removal Rate (MRR) in Abrasive Jet Machining using MATLAB. It calculates MRR based on input parameters such as:

- Abrasive flow rate
- Particle velocity

## Features
- MATLAB script to calculate MRR
- Based on mathematical models of AJM
- Useful for process optimization

## How to Use
1. Open mrr_calculation.m in MATLAB
2. Set your process parameters
3. Run the script to get MRR output
